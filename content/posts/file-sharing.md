Transferring files to a partner (recipient) is basically pretty easy.

Most of the time, only this has to be considered:

* **Which medium:** Via software or hardware
* **Which file format:** Pack in archive, split or send directly
* **What security requirements:** Password, encryption

External hard drives, USB sticks or disks (CD, DVD, Bluray) are available for transfer via hardware.
For the transfer via software, the internet is mostly used.

By the way, my **personal favorite** for sending files is the **Croc** program.
Unfortunately there is no graphic interface for it yet.

## Basic rules

Here are some basic rules for sending files:

1. [Not by e-mail!](#why-not-by-email) It cannot be said often enough.
2. Pictures and videos are compressed in [Instant Messenger, Chats](#why-should-i-avoid-messenger) and many websites! (Loss of quality)
3. Several files are packed into an archive and not sent individually!
4. If it is to be secure, it must be encrypted. (Password, end-to-end encryption)
5. Is the partner online (P2P) or is he offline (cloud or alternatives).

## Send files for noobs

Your partner (recipient) is an inexperienced user (total idiot) and has no idea what the Internet is.
In this case, you will be forced to use a remote maintenance tool.
You can either send the files directly via the tool or use another better variant.

**Remote maintenance tools:**

* [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/)
* [AnyDesk](https://anydesk.com/)

If you are an inexperienced user yourself, find someone to help you and/or explain what to do.

## File sending for beginners

Either you or your partner is a beginner, then the following will come in handy:

**Via Messenger:**

* [Threema](https://web.threema.ch/) (Limit: 150 MB)
* [Signal](https://signal.org/) (Limit: 100 MB)
* [WhatsApp](https://web.whatsapp.com/) (Limit: 150 MB)
* [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/) (Limit: 2 GB)
* [Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/) (Limit: 200 MB)

**Via cloud transfer services:**

Short-term storage using a share link or email address.

* [Dropbox Transfer](https://www.dropbox.com/transfer/) (Limit: 100 MB)
* [Wetransfer](https://wetransfer.com/) (Limit: 2 GB)
* [Send Anywhere](https://send-anywhere.com/)

**Via P2P:**

P2P (Peer to Peer), both must be online.

* [ShareDrop](https://www.sharedrop.io/)

## Send files for advanced users

You are able to handle the operating system and know what an archive is.

**Via cloud services:**

Permanent storage by sharing via a share link or email address.

* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)
* [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) (Must be provided by an expert)

**Archiving programs:**

* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (Password, split files)
* [WinRar](https://www.winrar.de/)

## File sending for experts

You know that the black window named "Terminal / Command" is not an accidental "Dark Mode".

**Sending files via terminal:**

* [Croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc)
* [Magic Wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole)

**Others:**

* [Create archives and split files](https://github.com/Cyb10101/notes/blob/master/Software/Archives.md)

## File sending for aliens

You're in IT and want to call your partner.
It means so much that you know exactly what that means down there and what you are doing with it.

**Because if you don't know and press the wrong button, you summon the gate to hell!**

**Tor Network:**

* [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/)
* [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/)

**Torrent Network:**

* [IPFS - InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/)

**Others:**

* [PGP](https://github.com/Cyb10101/notes/blob/master/Software/GPG.md)

## But why not?

Because there is nothing wrong with doing something sensible sometimes. Here are a few notes...

### Why not by email?

* Unsafe transmission, message and data can be read out
* Message size is limited (limit: 5 - 200 MB)
* The recipient's mailbox can fill up quickly
* If the recipient's mailbox is full, the complete e-mail is sometimes sent back to the sender

Basically, email is an outdated format and is only designed to send messages.
You can attach smaller files, but the format is not suitable for large files!

When sending a 60 MB file, the receiving service may only accept 5 MB.
Many people then send multiple emails because they don't know how else to transfer the files.

### Why should I avoid Messenger?

* Pictures and videos are compressed (loss of quality)
* Storage space may be limited (smartphone)
* Security concerns depending on the platform (encryption, trust in provider)

Instant messengers or chats are a better alternative to email.
Often the better easy way to send files.
Since the subject is huge, I'll limit myself to the negative things.

The first is that you have to trust the provider. Especially if no end-to-end encryption is used.
You can of course make do with having your own encryption, for example a password in the archive.

Images and videos are compressed and often not without loss. If you want the original, this file must be packed into an archive.

Sending large files should be avoided as these are actually sending messages in Messenger.
For example, you use too much storage space on your smartphone. But you can also delete the files again.
